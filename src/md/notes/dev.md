### Dev Notes

12/23/22:

Store configured, going to start with the simplest and move out, i.e Sticky, HotelView. Also going to switch to ```styled-components```.
The entire project is basically a giant UI with the exception of the center content, i.e the Rooms. It's big enough to need Redux but not
so big that styled components will get mixed up or confusing.

12/21/22:

Beginning to implement Redux (Toolkit, to be specific). I'd like to standardize the naming convention and src structure before
getting too deep. I don't want to end up with a million differents standards all laced together. Plan is to finish the front-end 
as thoroughly as possible. Along the way I'll factor in authentication. And at some point, hundreds of years from now, I'll get to
Rooms.\
\
More than likely I'll get deep into the archive side before getting to rooms. I'd like to basically build a client-side archive, 
similar to Habborator but built into the hotel.\

At this point I'm beginning to refactor stuff before getting too far. Someone recommended ```styled components```. That same
person recommended dealing with ```state``` now before I get too deep, so I'm going to begin instating Redux (once I learn
wtf it is and how it works)\

Things to refactor so far:

-- Sticky\
-- Notepad\
-- ID\
-- Console\
